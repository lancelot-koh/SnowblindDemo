10.	Support: SAP is solely responsible for providing, and Apple has no obligation to provide, maintenance and support for the Software. SAP may offer support for the Software – at its sole discretion – by e.g. provisioning of updates, patches, bug fixes and new versions via the Apple App Store according to SAP then current existing support offerings. In the event SAP provides such support via itunes, the timely availability of this support is dependent on Apple cooperation in due time for which SAP is not responsible.
11.	Data Protection: 
SAP and Company must comply with the provisions of the law of data protection. Where SAP is granted access (for example, for remote maintenance) to hardware and software that Company uses, it is not the intention that SAP process or use personal data for business purposes. Rather, transfer of personal data will only take place in exceptional circumstances, as an incidental effect of SAP’s performing its contractual duties.  If in the course of contract maintenance SAP stores, processes, or uses personal data, it will comply with Company’s instructions in that respect. Additional remuneration is payable by Company to the extent such instructions require goods, works, or services not included in the contract. SAP and Company must implement the technical and organizational measures required by the German Federal Data Protection Act, section 9 and the schedule thereto, to protect personal data from misuse. SAP will deploy on work involving the processing of personal data only personnel bound to data secrecy in the meaning of the German Federal Data Protection Act, section 5. SAP will bind to the applicable provisions of the law of data protection any subcontractor with access to personal data. If the subcontractor is not domiciled in the European Union (EU), SAP will take steps to achieve a level of data protection that is appropriate in accordance with EU data protection requirements. Company must ensure that all legal requirements on your part are met so that SAP can perform its contractual services without infringing the law. Company acknowledges and agrees that any of Company’s personal information will at all times be processed by SAP in accordance with its Privacy Policy (http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/our-company/legal/privacy.epx).
With regards to the processing of personal data, the following terms apply: Data controller in case of the Software is SAP SE, Dietmar-Hopp-Allee 16, 69190 Walldorf, with its data protection officer Mathias Cellarius. SAP will use your name, email and postal address (“Personal Data”) only for the purpose of providing you with access to the Software as further stated in this Agreement. SAP will only store your Personal Data for as long as it is required to provide you with access to the Software. Although the provisioning of Personal Data to SAP is absolutely voluntarily for you, SAP cannot provide you access to the Software without this information. When providing you with access to the Software, SAP may transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area where a level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the data protection laws of the European Economic Area. In order to close this gap any such transfer is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses. You may obtain a redacted copy (in order to remove commercial and not relevant information) of such Standard Contractual Clauses by sending a request to http://service.sap.com.
You can request from SAP at any time information about which Personal Data SAP has about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data (whereby SAP can only delete your Personal Data if there is no statutory contracting obligation to retain it). Kindly note that if you request from SAP the deletion of your Personal Data you will not be able to use the Software any longer. Furthermore, you can request from SAP that SAP restricts your Personal Data from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Data SAP has about you is incorrect, however, only for as long as SAP requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Data, (ii) there is no legal basis for SAP processing your Personal Data and you demand that SAP blocks your Personal Data from further processing, (iii) SAP does not longer require your Personal Data but you claim that you require such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims or (iv) in case you object against the processing of your Personal Data by SAP for as long as it is required to review as to whether SAP has a prevailing interest in processing your Personal Data. Please direct any such request to http://service.sap.com. If you take the view that SAP is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country where you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state where SAP has its registered seat
12.	Term and Termination: 
Company may terminate this Agreement by destroying all copies of the Software on Company’s Apple mobile device. SAP shall be entitled to terminate Company’s licenses to use the Software if Company or you fail to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement terminates automatically upon termination or expiration of the SAP Standard Software agreement between Company and either the respective SAP entity or the authorized SAP reselling partner. In case of termination or expiration of this Agreement, Company must destroy all copies of the Software on Company’s Apple mobile devices. 
13.	Law/Venue: 
German law applies exclusively to all claims in contract, in tort or otherwise, and the UN sales laws convention is excluded. If You are a merchant within the meaning of the German Commercial Code (HGB), section 1, or a public-law juristic person or special fund, the sole place of jurisdiction for all differences arising out of or in connection with the Software Agreement shall be Karlsruhe.
14.	Third Party Product License Terms:
14.1	Google Maps Service (“GM Service”). In case the Software accesses the GM Service through a Google Maps API, Company’s use of the GM Service is subject to Google’s Terms of Service which are set forth on: http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/.

Company’s usage of BM Service within the Software can be terminated by SAP without stating any reason at any time. In that case SAP is not required to provide an equivalent service via another provider. Company is not entitled to seek any damages thereof.
15.	Miscellaneous: 
This Agreement is the complete Agreement for the Software licensed (including reference to information/documentation contained in a URL). This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations with regards to the subject matter of this Agreement. If any term of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the surviving provisions shall remain effective. SAP´s failure to enforce any right or provisions stipulated in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such provision, or any other provision of this Agreement.
Company and SAP agree that: (a) this Agreement is between SAP and Company, and that Apple is not a party to this Agreement; (b) that SAP is solely responsible for the Software and the content thereof; (c) that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and d) Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against Company as a third party beneficiary hereof, but only if Company accepts the terms of this Agreement as outlined above.
